## Project: LifeTrack

LifeTrack is a desktop app for students to track their health data, 
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI). 
It tracks calories, hydration and sleep data for the user, 
while also providing daily recommendations for calorie and hydration intake, 
based on the user's build and gender, as well as their body goals and activity levels.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **New Feature**: Added the ability to read and write from a data file.
  - What it does: allows the application to store caloric/hydration/sleep entries that were input previously. Data is retrieved from a data file whenever the application is relaunched.
  - Justification: the user should be able to compare against all their previous calorie/hydration/sleep entries to monitor their health which is the very purpose of the application. Additionally, it is exceedingly inconvenient to have the application open all the time if there was no form of storage available, thus this capability is also a huge boost to the user's quality of life while using the application.
  - Highlights: This enhancement required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives, such as choosing a suitable delimiter when storing data. In this case, the delimiter needed to be a seldom used character to ensure that it does not show up too often in user input. The implementation was also challenging as there were many alternatives, including when and where to update the data file.

- **Project management**:
  - Managed releases `v1.0`, `v1.1` and `v2.0` on GitHub
  - Maintaining the issue tracker i.e. closing completed issues, labelling and assigning issues appropriately

- **Enhancements to existing features**:
  - Added capability for `calories in` inputs to take in an optional argument for macronutrients ([PR #39](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-F15-2/tp/pull/39))
  - Reorganized all exception messages into a new class for ease of viewing and editing ([PR #56](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-F15-2/tp/pull/56), [PR #160](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-F15-2/tp/pull/160))
  - Created `InputEntry` and `OutputEntry` classes to inherit the original `Entry` class to differentiate between a calorie input and output entry ([PR #39](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-F15-2/tp/pull/39))
  - Reorganized the `ParserCalories` class by extracting methods to make it more OOP-like ([PR #48](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-F15-2/tp/pull/48))
  - Reorganized JUnit test cases into individual classes for ease of access ([PR #48](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-F15-2/tp/pull/48))
  - Added JUnit tests for existing features ([PR #26](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-F15-2/tp/pull/26), [PR #56](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-F15-2/tp/pull/56))

- **Documentation**:
  - Developer Guide:
    - Added implementation details of the `Adding calorie entries feature`.
