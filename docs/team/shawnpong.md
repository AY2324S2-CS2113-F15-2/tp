## Project: LifeTrack
LifeTrack is a desktop app for students to track their health data,
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI).
It tracks calories, hydration and sleep data for the user,
while also providing daily recommendations for calorie and hydration intake,
based on the user's build and gender, as well as their body goals and activity levels.

The program was created using Java. Version control was done using Git.
